### Introduction
In this project, I did the analysis for Stack Overflow Survey Data 2019. This is a survey data which I took from their [website](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). This data contains nearly 90,000 responses from over 170 countries. I used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which you can find in the `Data Science Blog Post.ipynb` file.
<br>
<br>
For this analysis, I focused in answering these three questions:
1. Which country has the highest job satisfaction for developers ?
2. Is there the difference in job satisfaction between developers whose undergraduate major is IT-related an those who are not ?
3. Is there any differences in terms of salary between people who contribute to open source and those who are not?

### Result Summary
After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found:
1. United States has the highest job satisfaction level for developers in the world, and 5 of top 10 countries with the highest job satisfaction level are located in Europe.
2. Developers whose undergraduate major is not IT-related have slightly better job satisfaction.
3. Developers who contribute more to the open source have the higher salary (although ”does it have the direct causation?” is still debatable).

### Notes
Because I could not put the data in the github repository, you can download the data first from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV/view). <br> <br>
Download the data and save the `survey_results_public.csv` file in the same directory with this notebook.
